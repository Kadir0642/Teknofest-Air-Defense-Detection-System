Rapid Convergence:

 -The model learned the patterns in the training set with over 95% accuracy within the first 5 epochs. 
This steady decline in the loss graphs indicates that the dataset is compatible with the model's 
capacity and that the model did not experience underfitting.

High Precision & Recall: 

 -In air defense systems, a ‘false negative’ (missing the target) is unacceptable. 
A recall value of 0.99 proves that the system detects nearly all threats entering its field of view.
